# Gold Price Prediction and Trading Strategies
This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at predicting gold prices and developing trading strategies using historical gold price data. The models used in this project include Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Trading strategies are formulated based on volume and moving averages.

Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:
Time Series Analysis
Explore historical trends and patterns in gold prices from January 19, 2014, to January 22, 2024. Identify seasonality, cyclicality, and long-term trends in the gold market. Advanced Modeling

Develop predictive models to forecast future gold prices based on historical data. Evaluate and compare the performance of Linear Regression and LSTM models. Trading Strategy Development

Formulate and backtest trading strategies using volume and moving average indicators. Explore the feasibility of reverse trading strategies for profit maximization. Market Sentiment Analysis

Investigate the impact of market events on gold prices. Assess market sentiment and its influence on price movements. Statistical Analysis

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Nasdaq and includes daily gold prices over a ten-year period. The key financial metrics for each trading day are:

Date: The trading day identifier. Close: Closing price of gold. Volume: Gold trading volume. Open: Opening price of gold. High: Highest recorded price during the trading day. Low: Lowest recorded price during the trading day. Models Used Linear Regression A basic yet powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, Linear Regression is used to forecast gold prices based on historical data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems. LSTM models are employed to capture long-term dependencies in gold price data, providing more accurate forecasts compared to traditional models.

Trading Strategies Volume-Based Strategy This strategy involves analyzing trading volumes to make buy or sell decisions. High trading volumes often indicate significant market interest, which can precede price movements.

Moving Averages Strategy A popular technical analysis tool, moving averages help smooth out price data to identify trends. The strategy uses short-term and long-term moving averages to generate trading signals:

Buy Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average. Sell Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
